Package rgeo is a fast, simple solution for local reverse geocoding.

Rather than relying on external software or online APIs, rgeo packages all of
the data it needs in your binary. This means it will only ever work down to the
level of cities (though currently just countries), but if that's all you need
then this is the library for you.

rgeo uses data from [naturalearthdata.com](https://naturalearthdata.com), if
your coordinates are going to be near specific borders I would advise checking
the data beforehand (links to which are in the files).

## Installation

    go get github.com/sams96/rgeo

## Usage

```go
r, err := rgeo.New(Countries110)
if err != nil {
	// Handle error
}

loc, err := r.ReverseGeocode([]float64{0, 52})
if err != nil {
	// Handle error
}

fmt.Printf("%s\n", loc.Country)
fmt.Printf("%s\n", loc.CountryLong)
fmt.Printf("%s\n", loc.CountryCode2)
fmt.Printf("%s\n", loc.CountryCode3)
fmt.Printf("%s\n", loc.Continent)
fmt.Printf("%s\n", loc.Region)
fmt.Printf("%s\n", loc.SubRegion)

// Output: United Kingdom
// United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
// GB
// GBR
// Europe
// Europe
// Northern Europe
```
